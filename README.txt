COMP277 Homework 3

By: Jade Wu, Leopold Ringmayr


The AI-controlled character wanders around the field to harvest carrots and cabbages. Character will walk to the carrot or cabbage if it is ripe--carrots and cabbages have different ripening times. The character waits at the beginning until there is a ripe vegetable to move. 


Additional/creative game feature:  The character must harvest 3 items (can be cabbage or carrot) before depositing them in the container at the bottom right corner of the screen. Only after putting these harvested items in the container can the character resume their harvest. In other words, the character walks to the container after harvesting 3 items, stows these 3 items away, and then resumes their harvest. The character will deposit dead plants that they collect into the designated compost bin in the bottom left corner of the screen.
